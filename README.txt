To compile, type "make" from within the P3 directory

Implement using ./statSem [test file] without extension 

To clean, type "make clean"

Outstanding Issues: 

Gives expected output for test files p3gg1, p3gb1, p3gb2, p3gb3
Does not give extected output for test files p3gg2 and p3gb4

Chose to do the global option
